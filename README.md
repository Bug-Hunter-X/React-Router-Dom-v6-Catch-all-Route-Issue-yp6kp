This repository demonstrates a common issue with catch-all routes (`/*`) in React Router Dom v6.  The problem arises when the catch-all route unintentionally intercepts all navigation attempts, preventing other defined routes from functioning properly. The solution provides a corrected routing configuration to resolve this issue.
